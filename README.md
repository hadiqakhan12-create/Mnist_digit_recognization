Task 2: MNIST Digit Recognition
**Objective:** To build a Machine Learning model that can accurately identify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset.

**Key Features:**
- **Dataset:** MNIST-784 (70,000 images of handwritten digits).
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier.
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Project Flow:**
1. Loaded the dataset using `fetch_openml`.
2. Preprocessed the pixel data for 28x28 images.
3. Trained a Random Forest model to recognize patterns in the pixels.
4. Achieved an accuracy of over 96% on the test set.

**Outcome:**
Successfully demonstrated the ability to apply Supervised Learning to a Computer Vision problem.
